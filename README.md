# gifTastic-Homework 6 
Homework 6

In this assignment users chose any city by typing in the name ex. "Boston" or "Miami, Flordia" and the page pulls up ten static gifs related to the city. Upon clicking the gif it will animate and clicking the gif again will make it still.

This is coded in javascript and jquery and ajax. I retrieved an API key and created an Ajax function which pulls up the ten gifs. I have also styled the page with Bootstrap and remade the buttons and used a background image of the New Orleans skyline.

#Using the Page
There are no special requirements for using this site, just a webbrowser.
